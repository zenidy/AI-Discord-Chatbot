# Discord-Bot
AI Integrated discord bot utilizing OpenAI SDK.

Currently using Deepseek but you can easily switch it over to ChatGPT.

Currently working on a more intuitive way to launch the bot, right now in VSC just execute node index.js in the terminal.

HOW TO USE (Deepseek):
1. Install node.js
2. Install Discord API into your directory
3. Install OpenAI SDK into your directory
4. Within the .env file, add in your keys to your Discord API and Deepseek key.
5. Within the terminal, run "node index.js", it should return in the console that the bot has logged in with the username.
